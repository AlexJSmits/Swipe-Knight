Task
- Need to make swipe hitbox and enemies slightly bigger 
- Reduce mass / gravity and y force on enemies to create more floaty feel
- give trail renderer more verticies to make it smoother and bendier

Ideas
- if enemies collide before they have been defeated they combine to create a super enemy with more health (Slime Bat)
- Boss's have a small shield they move around that temporarily stops your swipe from working if you hit it (1 second)
